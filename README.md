## INTRODUCTION

 My site was inspired in my family business , which my father in law has a vineyard and produce a wines. My goal was try to improve his website and at least to show a diferent way to promote his business in the simple way and an easier and better website.
 
 ## DESIGN
 
 the desing of the website was based on simple things:
  - Two fonts were used on the page Crimson Text , Dancing Script.
    - Dancing Script for all titles
    - Crimson Text for all text
  - All tiltles with same sizes and text as well. All text in all page is black.
  - Two main coulors were used to combine with the rose wine ( #8e6a20 and #e05d332)
  - All text and pictures to be center in each section,to look better organised and simple.


## WIREFRAME

The initial wireframes produced by me, is not matching what is final result.

I have sticked always with the main struture, which was :

- heading with menu and title 
- main picture for the vineyard
- section for history of the business 
- section for type of wines we are producing 
- section of booking for Tours in the vineyard
- footer 
    
Along the project, was important the meetings with my mentor Reuben which guide me to try to make the site looking better and simple.

## RESPONSIVE

To be responsive was using IPAD air and Iphone 12 as examples to make sure is responsible.

The heading was created to have just three links for History/Wines/Tour. i have tried to not take too much space with it, and make the title of the vineyard more visible. That was always the main goal.

## History Section

This section was thought to be simple with two divs. A text and a picture of the CEO, both are in thecenter to each div. the goal was to no make the text too long and divided by two areas.

## Wines Section

This section was split in 3 types of wines , centered and not with too many colours and with a frame around it. which frame contains the wine, a description of the wine and then a line to separate from the purchase buttom.
