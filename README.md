1. INTRODUCTION
 
 My site was inspired in my family business , which my father in law has a vineyard and produce a wines. my goal was try to improve his website and at least to show a diferent way to promote his business in the simple way and an easier and better website.
 
 2. DESIGN
 
 the desing of the website was based on simple things:
  - two fonts. 1 font for all titles and other font to all text.
  - all tiltles with same sizes and text as well
  - two main coulors to combine with the rose wine
  - all text and picture to be center in each section, it looks better organised


3. WIREFRAME

The initial wireframes produced by me, is not matching what is final result.

I have sticked always with the main struture, which was :
      - heading with menu and title 
      - main picture for the vineyard
      - section for history of the business 
      - section for type of wines we are producing 
      - section of booking for Tours in the vineyard
      - footer 
    
4. Along the project, was important the meetings with my mentor Reuben which guide me to try to make the site looking better and simple.

5. RESPONSIVE

To be responsive was using IPAD air and Iphone 12 as examples to make sure is responsible at 100%

The heading was created to have just three links for History/Wines/Tour. i have tried to not take too much space with it, and make the title of the vineyard more visible. that was always the main goal.

8. History Section
this section was thought to be simple with two divs. text and a picture of the CEO. both are center to each div. the goal was to no make the text too long and divided by two areas.

9. Wines Section
this section was split in 3 types of wines , centered and not with too many colours and with a frame around it. which frame contains the wine, a description of the wine and then a line to separate from the purchase buttom.

10. Tour Section
this was based on details to be put onto the website to allows you to enter all information required to confirm a booking. which means, name, address, card details and then confirming the booking. below this there is a map to show the location for the tour.
