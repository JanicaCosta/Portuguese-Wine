## INTRODUCTION

 My site was inspired in my family business , which my father in law has a vineyard and produce a wines. my goal was try to improve his website and at least to show a diferent way to promote his business in the simple way and an easier and better website.
 
 ## DESIGN
 
 the desing of the website was based on simple things:
  - Two fonts were used on the page Crimson Text , Dancing Script. All text in black.
    - Dancing Script for all titles
    - Crimson Text for all text
  - All tiltles with same sizes and text as well.
  - Two main coulors to combine with the rose wine ( #8e6a20 and #e05d332)
  - All text and pictures to be center in each section, it looks better organised.


## WIREFRAME

The initial wireframes produced by me, is not matching what is final result.

I have sticked always with the main struture, which was :

- heading with menu and title 
- main picture for the vineyard
- section for history of the business 
- section for type of wines we are producing 
- section of booking for Tours in the vineyard
- footer 
    
Along the project, was important the meetings with my mentor Reuben which guide me to try to make the site looking better and simple.

The heading was created to have just three links for History/Wines/Tour. i have tried to not take too much space with it, and make the title of the vineyard more visible. that was always the main goal.

## History Section

this section was thought to be simple with two divs. text and a picture of the CEO. both are center to each div. the goal was to no make the text too long and divided by two areas.

## Wines Section

this section was split in 3 types of wines , centered and not with too many colours and with a frame around it. which frame contains the wine, a description of the wine and then a line to separate from the purchase buttom.
